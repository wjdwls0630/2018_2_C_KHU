In this new vision for a university that transcend
s the traditional notion of the university as a mer
e physical location and the limitations of an exclu
sive academe, Kyung Hee University will rise to int
ernational prestige and develop into an internation
al center of research, education, and praxis that b
rings together reality and imagination, the basics 
and applied sciences, and theory and practice.
