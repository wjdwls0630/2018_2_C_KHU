On its 60th anniversary in 2009, Kyung Hee University
prepared for a second leap forward while seeking a new
paradigm of future university development. It reflected on
the fundamental mission of the University and established
a new vision and goals for becoming a true university of
the future.
In this new vision for a university that transcends the
traditional notion of the university as a mere physical
location and the limitations of an exclusive academe, Kyung
Hee University will rise to international prestige and
develop into an international center of research, education,
and praxis that brings together reality and imagination, the
basics and applied sciences, and theory and practice.
