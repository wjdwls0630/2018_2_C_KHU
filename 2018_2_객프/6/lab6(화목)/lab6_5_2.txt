In this paper, we explore the feasi
bility of a medical training system 
for breast tumor palpation based on 
haptic augmented reality (AR) techno
logy. Haptic AR is an emerging resea
rch area in haptics and virtual real
ity (VR), which is concerned with au
gmenting the haptic properties of a 
real object by means of virtual hapt
ic feedback. The AR-based tumor palp
ation system consists of a real brea
st sample.
